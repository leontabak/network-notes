        <h3>Biography on Famous Computer Scientist</h3>
        <h4>Radia Perlman</h4>
        <p>Radia Perlman is one of the few women of the time in the field of computer science. She loved arty things growing up like music, composting and playing, also she liked to make everything the best it could be. She was very focused on her record and wanting straight A’s which she now regrets and wishes she was less worried about it. She fell in to computer science by accident, her teachers assistant in a class just asked her if she wanted to be a programmer in a project they were doing because she seemed smart and she got her boyfriend at the time to teacher her. That inspired her and her first paying computer job was 1971. She even designed a programming language with a teaching programming concepts to much younger children. Even at MIT she was one of very few women in the school. She had to remind herself when she saw other women in classes that she was also an other like them. She says not much in her time has changed for the women in the field. It may look like there is a big push for women but she says that hiring is still very subjective and it is very difficult to change. The diversity that she wants is  not a physical thing it is much more a diversity in thinking that will be the most help. She wishes that young people would realize that life is unfair, everyone is insecure and it is ok to ask for help. She hates that she is called the mother of the Internet because the Internet was not invented by any individual and in her own words “There are lots of people who like to take credit for it, and it drives them crazy when anyone other than them seems to want credit, so it seems best to just stay out of their way” but she does know that she did contribute to fundamental underlying infrastructure but she doesn't like the idea of any one person taking credit.     </p>
