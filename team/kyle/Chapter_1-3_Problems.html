	+ 01100110 <br>

	&nbsp; &nbsp;   10111001 <br>

	1's compliment: 11010001 <br>
	<br>
	UDP takes the 1's compliment because when it is added to the sum, it should read 11111111. <br>
	If there is a zero, then there is an error.<br>
	It isn't possible for a 1 bit error to make it through, but a 2 bit error could if the 2 bits cancelled each other out.<br>
	For example: if the last bit of the first byte was changed to a zero and the last bit of the second byte was changed to a 1, the result of the checksum would be the same.
