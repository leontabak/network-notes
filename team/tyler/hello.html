        Section 1.6: Networks Under Attack
        
        Malware: Data from the internet that infects hosts for malicious intent. Examples include spyware (collects private
        information, to send back to the origin of the spyware for their use), or deleting files from the host.
        
        Once infected with malware, hosts may inadvertently be enrolled in a botnet.
        Botnet: A network of hosts infected with malware, controlled by the malware distributor, to be used to further spread
        malware through spam email, or to perform a DoS attack against some host they have a bone to pick with.
        
        Most malware is Self Replicating: Can spread itself from one host to another, growing at a potentially exponential
        pace.
        
        Malware is spread in two ways, Viruses, and Worms.
        Viruses: Malware that requires the host's user to interact with it in some way. The text uses a very simple email
        spam example, where a user opens an attached document that runs malicious code of some sort, such as installing
        spyware.
        Worms: Malware that can enter a device without the host's user interaction. The text again provides an example.
        If you were to run a network application that was vulnerable to the worm, the application could accept this
        malware and install it without the user knowing it. Once in a host, worms scan other computers in the network, and
        attack any other hosts that are running the same vulnerable application.
        
        DoS attacks: an attack that renders a host, network, or infrastructure unusable by legitimate users.
        DoS attacks typically come in one of three flavors:Vulnerability Attacks, Bandwith Flooding, and Connection Flooding.
        The only type that the text goes into are Bandwithd Flooding, which is typically performed via
        DDoS attack. DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service attack. Essentially, the attackers uses 'slave' hosts
        from a botnet to send traffic to the target, until it cant handle the stress of the increased traffic.
        
        Packet Sniffers are programs that 'sniff' packets being sent through a network. Wireshark, which we used in class
        today, is a packet sniffer, for instance. People can place packet sniffers and attempt to aquire packets containing
        users personal information. Packet sniffers are hard to detect, since they don't actually add anything to the network,
        just read from it.
        
        IP Spoofing: Sending a packet with a fake source address. Basically, this would be like sending someone a letter with
        an address from one of their friends, so that they are more likely to open it. Though in this case that letter would
        containt malware. So for a real world example, if that letter contained nothing but exploding glitter. And then that
        glitter burned your house down.
