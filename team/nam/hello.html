        Hello, I'm Nam. I'm from Vietnam. I'm a senior, majoring in Computer Science. <br/>
        I hope we will all have fun and learn a lot from this class.

    	<h2>CHAPTER 1.6 Networks Under Attack</h2>
    	<ol>
    		<li><h4>Malware<h4></li>
    			<p>Malware can: deleting our files, installing spyware the steal private information.</p>
    			<p>A botnet: is a network of infected devices, controlled by bad guys.</p>
    			<p>Self-replication: once malware infects one host, from that host, it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet</p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Viruses</li>
    				<p>Are malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the user's device.</p>
    			<li>Worms</li>
    				<p>Are malware that can enter a device without any explicit user interaction.</p>
    		</ul>
    		<li><h4>Attacking servers and network infrastructure</h4></li>
    			<h5>Denial-of-service (DOS) attack</h5>
    			<ul>
    				<li>Vulnerability Attack</li>
    					<p>This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable
application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right
sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the
service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.</p>
    				<li>Bandwidth flooding</li>
    					<p>The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted
host—so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged, preventing
legitimate packets from reaching the server.</p>
						<p>Distributed DOS (DDOS) attack: the attacker controls multiple sources
and has each source send traffic at the target. With this approach, the aggregate traffic
rate across all the controlled sources needs to be approximately R to cripple the service.</p>
    				<li>Connection Flooding</li>
    					<p>The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or
fully open TCP connections at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with 
these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.</p>
    			</ul>

    		<li><h4>Sniffing packets</h4></li>
    		<ul>
    			<li><p>Packet sniffer: a passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by, 
    				when it's placed in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter.</p></li>
    			<li><p>Sniffer can be deployed also in wired environment.</p></li>
    			<li><p>Sniffed packets can then be analyzed offline for sensitive information.</p></li>
    		</ul>
    		<li><h4>Pretending as someone you trust</h4></li>
    			<ul>
    				<li><p>IP spoofing: The ability to injectpackets into the Internet with a false source address,
    				and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.</p></li>
    				<li><p>End-point authentication: a mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does.</p></li>
    			</ul>
    	</ol>
