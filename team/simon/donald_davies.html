    Core to the inner workings of the Internet is the concept of packet switching; the versatility and efficiency of such a system, as opposed to circuit switching, makes such a massively complex network possible. This concept was not birthed wholly in the mind of one, and in fact, many researchers working just before the advent of the Internet had similar ideas. Among the most notable of these researchers was Donald Davies, a Welsh computer scientist who went on to coin the term &#34;packet switching&#34; itself.

    Davies was born in Treorchy, a small village in the Rhonnda Valley of Wales, in June of 1924. Despite a modest upbringing, he went on to attend the Imperial College in London where he received subsequent BSc&#39;s in Physics and Mathematics, both times receiving the highest honors. During his last year of schooling, Davies attended a lecture by John Womersley, head of the mathematics division at NPL (National Physical Laboratory), where he first learned of the facility&#39;s emergent computer research. After graduating, Davies NPL&#39;s research team developing the ACE computer, a project led by Alan Turing. There was little comradery between Turing and Davies. The young researcher, hoping to achieve Turing&#39;s respect, elucidated several mathematical errors in the paper proposing the &#34;universal Turing machine.&#34; &#34;I went along to tell him and I was rather cock-a-hoop ...  he was very annoyed,&#34; Davies later recounted.

    The ACE project proved overambitious, but after Turing departed, Davies stayed on to lead the development of a smaller device, the Pilot ACE, notable today as the first computer in London and the basis of several successful commercial spin-offs. Davies would only invest more time into the development of computer software, developing programs for simulating road traffic and translating technical Russian to English. He advanced quickly through the ranks of NPL, becoming the technical manager of their Advanced Computer techniques division in 1963 and subsequently leading the entirety of the computing division in 1966.

  After his promotion, Davies steered the department towards a problem he&#39;d witnessed during a visit to MIT in 1965. It was here that one of the first computer networks had been instituted, based on circuit switching technology; students could sit at a personal terminal with a direct connection to the mainframe, and reserve a fixed percentage of networks bandwidth to issue commands. Because the students spent so much of their time thinking, and so little time actually inputting commands, much of the bandwidth went unutilized. Davies sought to rectify this by designing a system around the bursty nature of human communication, reducing the multiple parallel connections to a single, shared link and splitting the messages sent through it into discrete packets. He called this system &#34;packet switching,&#34; and had lofty plans to incorporate it into the national telecommunications infrastructure. Despite successful trials in an experimental network at NPL, the British government resisted Davie&#39;s ambitions for many years. Before any further progress was made in the UK, DARPA researcher Larry Roberts decided to incorporate Davie&#39;s research into his own fledgling network, Arpanet, a prototype that paved the way for the future development of the internet.

  After relinquishing his position at NPL in 1979, Donald Davies continued private research in the field of communications, focusing the bulk of his efforts in network security. After his retirement in 1984, he was known for some time as a great authority on wartime cryptography, a natural consequence of his knowledge of computer history and experience in security.

Davies passed away in May of 2000, and was survived by his wife of 45 years, Diane Burton, and their three children.
