		<u>UDP Highlights</u>
	</h2>
	<p>Although UDP is less reliable than TCP, it still finds use in many applications where its flexibility, speed, and lightweight nature outweigh its inherent flaws.	
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>UDP is no frills, and as such, there is no throttling of its handled messages. TCP attempts to handle congestion through the restriction of bandwidth, but any messages sent through UDP will be immediately handled. UDP can also send messages, as needed, in immediate succesion, where its counterpart would require acquisition confirmation after each message before sending the next.
		</li>
		<li>UDP establishes no consistent connection, and so no tracking of connection state is required. This necessity limits the number of possilbe concurrent TCP connections, a weakness UDP does not share.
		</li>
		<li>UDP uses significantly less header space than TCP (8 to 20 bytes, respectively).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	<p>Applications that often utilize UDP include media streaming services, routing protocol, network management, and DNS.
	<p>

	<h3><u>UDP Checksum</u></h3>
	<p>Because UDP operates independently from lower level protocols, it cannot guarantee that any of these will provide their own error detection. UDP provides its own in the form of an 8 byte checksum. At the message source, three random 16 bit numbers are added; the 1's complement* of this sum is calculated, and then appended to the segment. When the message arrives at its destination, the receiver sums all of the numbers. If this yields a new 16 bit number of all 1's, the checksum is successful.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h4><em>Thoughts: Liabilities?</em></h4>
	<p>It seems as if it might be possible that the checksum would yield a false positive under some, rare circumstances. What if an error causes differences in both the sum and the complement, such that said errors cancel? What if the bits in the segment sections surrounding the checksum have been altered, while the checksum itself remains intact?</p>
	<br>
	<h5 style="text-align:right;"><em>*The 1's compliment of a binary number is simply a conversion of all of its 1's to 0's, and vice versa.</em></h6>
