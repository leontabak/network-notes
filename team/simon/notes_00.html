	<h2>
		<u>Day One</u>

	<p>
		I chose to expand on 1.7.5, <em> The New Millenium, </em> as <br>
		the statistics that this text are based on were taken in 2012. Each <br>
		bullet point given had the potential for future addendum, and as <br>
		technical statistics swiftly, inevitably change, I am highlighting <br>
		some of the larger trends and changes in networking since the text's publication.
    </p>
	<ul>
			
			<li>84% of households in developed countries have internet access.</li>
			<li>LTE exploded after 2012, developing from covering less than 1 billion to nearly <br>
			4 billion in 2016. 3G networks cover 2.5 billion more people. Over 90 percent of the <br>
			developed world has mobile internet access in some form.</li>
			<li>Deployed in 2013, IEEE 802.11ac allows theoretical transmission rates of 1 Gbps, <br>
			vastly overshadowing 802.11b's max speed of 54 Mbps (as mentioned in the book).</li>
			<li>In 2012, US average internet speeds hovered around 6.6 Mbps. By 2016, this figure<br>
			had risen to 15.3 Mbps.</li>
			<li>Cloud computing has expanded rapidly. By 2017, it is expected to comprise the <br>
			majority of all IT spending by organizations.</li>
			<li>IoT (Internet of Things) is a newer trend, describing the addition of internet <br>
			functionality into existing technology. It is predicted that over 22 billion IoT <br>
			devices will exist by 2018.</li>
			
	</ul>
